	 * loading associated collections independently triggers an initial query plus N
	 * subsequent queries for each record fetched. Utilizing an EntityGraph forces
	 * Hibernate to perform an optimized SQL {@code LEFT OUTER JOIN FETCH} operation. This
	 * reduces the database overhead to exactly 1 query execution. While Eager loading via
	 * EntityGraph increases the initial memory footprint in the JVM, it heavily mitigates
	 * database latency and network round-trips during high-throughput search operations,
	 * providing a highly performant and stable system under production loads.
